							<h2>Peter McDonald-Ryder</h2>
							<p>I am a creative, passionate and expressive video game designer with a natural skill for storytelling and crafting new worlds.</p>
							<p>My main motivation is to create living and breathing worlds that players can inhabit and engage with. I believe that this is best achieved not only through the design of unique experiences and events that draw people into the world, but also by building a place they want to explore and be a part of.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Game Design</h2>
									<p>I am passionate about both playing and building all genres and styles of games. From single player fantasy games where anyone can mount up on their mighty steed and ride off in search of adventure, to multiplayer sci-fi space games where the story is partially formed by the players that take part in it. And of course... everything in between.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Illhugi's Crypt - Design Document</h3>
											<p>This document is a record of an experiment with the Skyrim Creation Kit, where my goal was to gain experience with a new creation tool. Using Bethesda's tutorials as a framework, I created a short and unique dungeon with its own story, theme and encounters, building upon my storytelling skills and experience, and deep knowledge of the Skyrim lore.</p>

											<h3>Legendary Article of 2015 in the Eighth Annual Halo Fanon Wikia Awards</h3>
											<h3>Best SPARTAN of 2015 in the Eighth Annual Halo Fanon Wikia Awards</h3>
											<p>Spartan-G127 is both a dedicated leader and a skilled fighter, though considered to be an average combatant in his company he maintains a much more unorthodox style of warfare than many of his compatriots. He is quick thinking and will often consider paths that others would write off as dangerous or to ridiculous. He can also be an inspiring presence to those around him and maintains a certain boyish charm that has made him a well like member of the Spartan Branch.</p>

											<h3>Best Sangheili Character of 2014 in the Seventh Annual Halo Fanon Wikia Awards</h3>
											<p>Not all legends are tales of heroics and valour. Some instead talk of grim tales soaked in the blood of fallen enemies, others of people thrust into terrible situations that learn through hardships to be more than they are. The tale of Tal ‘Zerex is all of these. To some he was a bloody handed slaughterer, a criminal and a villain. To others he was an inspiring presence, a hero and symbol of defiance. An outcast or a leader, an animal or a lost soul, a friend or a foe. Tal bears many labels, but through all the stories there exists a lonely warrior trying to seek a place in a harsh and unforgiving galaxy.</p>

											<h3>Voted Fanon of the Month on Halo Fanon</h3>
											<p>Shepard took a step out of the dropship onto Merken's glassed surface. The slow ticking of the ships engine as it cooled was the only sound in the otherwise grey wasteland. A miserable wind tugged at his coat as he looked back into the ship, seeing Kodiak standing just inside the cockpit.
											</br></br>"I'll just be twenty minutes" said Shepard, with a voice as bleak as the land around him.</p>
